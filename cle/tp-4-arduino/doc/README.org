#+TITLE: Embedded project 

* Introduction 

** Hardware/Software platform

   The following exercises will be done on a Arduino Uno platform.  To
   program the platform, you need to use one of the two IDEs :

   - The Arduino IDE (which is already available on the machines in A11) 

   - [[https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest//what-is-platformio.html][Platform IO]], which is available as a plugin of VSCode. Please
     follow the instruction on the web site to install it on the
     machines of A11.
 

** Seeed studio tutorials 

   The sensors and actuators that we will use are part of the Seeed
   Studio [[https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Starter-Kit-for-Arduino-p-1855.html][Grove Arduino Starter Kit]].

   You can find some video lectures on how to use the Seeed Studio
   Shield and the kit :

   Here are the Starter Kit examples that you can download and try on
   the board.

** Description  

   The objective of this student project is to develop a prototype of
   a small gadget for Christmas with an Arduino board.

   The application changes from one mode to the other depending on the
   status of the button and of other sensors, according to the
   following state machine:

   #+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file application-sm.png
   @startuml
   [*] --> Mode123
   state Mode123 {
     [*] --> Time

     state Light {
        Bright --> Dark : light_on
        Dark   --> Bright : light_off
     }

     Time -> Temp   : tick_up 
     Temp --> Light : tick_up
     Light --> Time : tick_up

     Temp -> Time   : tick_dw
     Light --> Temp : tick_dw
     Time --> Light : tick_dw
   }

   Christmas -> Mode123 : button
   Mode123 -> Christmas : button

   @enduml
   #+END_SRC

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :float :width .4\textwidth
   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:application-sm.png]]

   The events are the following:
   - The =button= event corresponds to a button press;
   - The =tick_up= event corresponds to turning the potentiometer to
     the right for one tick;
   - The =tick_dw= event corresponds to turning the potentiometer to
     the left for one tick.
   - The =light_off= event corresponds to the light sensor not
     detecting enough light (you will need to set a threshold for the
     detected light).
   - The =light_on= is when the light is sensor detects enough light.

   The states are the following:

   1) In state =Time= the display shows the number of
      seconds since the device has been reset on the display.

   2) In state =Temp=, the display shows on the display the value of
      the temperature sensor (in Celsius degrees).

   3) In state =Christmas= :
      - the buzzer starts to play a Christmas tune (for example,
        Jingle Bells);
      - the display shows the Christmas date: =25:12=.

   4) State =Light= has two substates:
	  - state =Bright= turns the backlight of the display on, and
        shows the string "Merry Christmas"

	  - state =Dark= turns the backlight of the display off, and shows
        the string "Happy new year".
   
   While playing the music in the Christmas mode, the music should
   stop immediately as soon as the state machine exits the state. When
   entering the state again later, the music continue from where it
   were interrupted.
   
   The value of the potentiometer should be discretized between
   =0-9=. When the user turns the potentiometer from one value to the
   next one, the buzzer should play a short "click" sound. For
   example, if the current value is a 4, and the user turns the
   potentiometer clockwise to reach value 5, then the buzzer plays a
   short "click" and triggers the =tick_up= event.  If the counter
   decreases (ex. from 7 to 6) then the buzzer plays a click sound,
   and the =tick_dw= event is triggered.  Additionally, the step motor
   turns anticlockwise when the counter decreases and clockwise when
   the counter increases.
   
** Development
  
   Develop the application using Arduino. Use techniques similar to
   the one used for code-generation from StateCharts to properly
   organize your code. Pay attention, the memory is *very limited*.
